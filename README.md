Normalization of a Table

## Overview

**Normalization:**
Normalization is the process of organizing data into database where there is no data redundancy and data is stored cleanly and logically.

## Types of Normalization

# 1NF [First Normal Form]
Each field should have only one value

# 2NF[Second Normal Form]
Must be in 1NF and there should be no partial dependency(non key attribute should only depend upon primary key)

# 3NF[Third Normal Form]
Must be in 2NF and there should be no transitive dependency(a non key attribute should not be defined using another non key attribute)
